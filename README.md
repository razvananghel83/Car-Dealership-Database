# Car-Dealership-Database
A project built for DBMS and Databases classes.

Two word documents are included, one for each class. The Database project is more focused on SQL queries and normalization, while the DBMS project is centered around PL/SQL languege and cleverly using its componenets to add useful functionality to the database.

Source code is also included.
